       <h3>Other Gases</h3>
       <p>Gases like the oxides of Nitrogen and Sulphur causes air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO2 .It is one of several nitrogen oxides. NO2 is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of nitric acid, millions of tons of which are produced each year for use primarily in the production of fertilizers.</p>
       <p>Sulphur dioxide  is the chemical compound with the formula SO2. It is a toxic gas responsible for the smell of burnt matches. It is released naturally by volcanic activity and is produced as a by-product of copper extraction and the burning of fossil fuels contaminated with sulphur compounds.</p>
