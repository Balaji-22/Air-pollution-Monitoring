       <h3>Carbon Dioxide</h3>
       <p>Carbon Dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is an acidic colorless gas with a density about 53% higher than that of dry air. Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. CO2 is produced by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. </p>
       <p>Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid.</p>
